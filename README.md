# RML-LDES Test Cases

The [RML-LDES](http://rml.io/) test cases are used to determine the conformance to the [RML-LDES specification](https://w3id.org/rml/ldes) of tools that execute RML-LDES rules.

In the folder `test-cases` you can find the different test cases.
Each test case is contained in a single folder, containing three types of files:

- A base and change RML-LDES mapping file written in Turtle: `base.rml.ttl` and `change.rml.ttl`.
- A base and change input file in JSON: `base.json` and `change.json`.
- A base and change output file in N-Quads: `output-base.nq` and `output-change.nq`.

The details about the test cases cases are also available as a knowledge graph in `metadata.nt`.
The knowledge graph is generated by executing the RML rules in `rules.ttl`, available as [YARRRML](https://w3id.org/yarrrml) in `rules.yml`.
The data source used by the rules is `metadata.csv`.

## Getting the RDF metadata

The metadata RDF is generated based on the metadata.csv file and the rules.yml YARRRML file, you can use following commands to re-generate them.

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases/download/v6.0.0/rmlmapper-6.0.0-r363-all.jar -o rmlmapper.jar # Feel free to use the latest release at https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases
npm i -g @rmlio/yarrrml-parser
yarrrml-parser -i rules.yml -o rules.ttl -p # If the rules file changed
java -jar ./rmlmapper.jar -m ./rules.ttl -o ./metadata.nt
java -jar ./rmlmapper.jar -m ./rules.ttl -o ./metadata.hdt -s hdt
```

## Documentation

A website describing the test cases is available in `docs`.
The website is generated by doing the following:

1. Install node.js dependencies: `npm i`
2. Run [Eleventy](http://11ty.io/): `npx eleventy`
3. Find the website in the folder `_site`

Snapshots of the website can be found in `snapshots`.
